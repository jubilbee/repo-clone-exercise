# Purpose of this repo
A simple practice exercise for students in the Code:You Intro module. Students will be:
- practicing using GitHub's markdown language

- push made changes to their own repo

## Instructions
I'm leaving out the specific commands to accomplish 1 and 3 as an exercise for you to figure out.

1. In your projects folder, clone this repo.
2. Create a file called ```about.md``` and perform the tasks in it. As you progress, check off the tasks you've completed and ensure that you're committing the README changes as well. You can use the text editor of your choice like Notepad or VS Code for editing the files.
3. Push the changes to you own repo.
